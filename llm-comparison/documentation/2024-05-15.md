# Session Update - 2024-05-15

## Changes Made
- Created basic input-section without shadcn/ui due to installation issues
- Implemented ResponseSection.tsx with TypeScript interfaces
- Set up core component structure with proper TypeScript types
- Added ModelResponse interface for response handling
- Implemented loading, error, and complete states for responses
- Added clipboard functionality for response copying
- Configured proper directory structure for components
- Failed to initialize shadcn/ui (will revisit)
- Created main page component with responsive layout
- Implemented types system with response interfaces
- Added mock API integration for testing

## Implementation Progress
- InputSection component completed with:
  * Prompt input textarea
  * Model selection buttons
  * Submit button with loading state
  * Basic error handling
- ResponseSection component completed with:
  * Grid layout for multiple responses
  * Loading spinner animation
  * Error state display
  * Response display with copy functionality
  * Time taken display
- Page Component completed with:
  * 12-column responsive grid layout
  * State management for responses
  * Sequential model processing
  * Error handling per model
  * Loading state management
- Types System implemented:
  * ModelResponse interface
  * ComparisonRequest interface
  * ComparisonResponse interface

## Technical Decisions
- Opted for pure Tailwind CSS instead of shadcn/ui temporarily
- Implemented 12-column grid system for responsive layout
- Used sequential API processing to prevent overwhelming the system
- Separated types into dedicated files for better organization
- Added mock API with artificial delays for testing
- Implemented real-time state updates for better UX
- Used TypeScript for type safety throughout

## Critical Decision: UI Framework
After discovering the ShadCN CLI update fix:
```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
npx shadcn@latest add [component]
```
Decision made to continue with pure Tailwind CSS because:
- Current components are stable and working
- Focus needed on core functionality
- Can implement ShadCN later if needed
- Avoiding refactoring time costs

## File Structure Updates
```bash
app/
├── page.tsx                # New main page component
├── types/
│   └── responses.ts       # New types definitions
└── components/
    ├── input-section/
    │   └── InputSection.tsx    # Completed with basic Tailwind
    ├── response-section/
    │   └── ResponseSection.tsx # Added with response handling
    └── metrics-section/        # Pending implementation
```

## Code Implementations
### Page Component Features:
- Responsive grid layout (1/12 columns)
- State management for responses
- Error handling system
- Loading state management
- Mock API integration

### Type System Features:
- ModelResponse interface for response handling
- ComparisonRequest interface for API requests
- ComparisonResponse interface for API responses
- Proper TypeScript integration

## Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "clsx": "latest",
    "tailwind-merge": "latest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "latest",
    "@types/node": "latest",
    "typescript": "latest"
  }
}
```

## Known Issues
- shadcn/ui installation failing with command not found
- Need to properly set up clsx and tailwind-merge
- TypeScript showing 3 errors in components
- Response section needs proper error boundary
- Mock API needs to be replaced with real implementation

## Database Integration Status
Prepared for API implementation with schema:
1. Prompt Model:
   - UUID primary key
   - One-to-many with Responses
2. Response Model:
   - Related to prompts
   - One-to-one with Metrics
3. Metrics Model (Educational focus):
   - Clarity (0-100)
   - Accuracy (0-100)
   - Depth (0-100)
   - Engagement (0-100)
   - Helpfulness (0-100)
   - Response Time (ms)
4. ComparisonSession:
   - Ready for tracking features

## Environment Variables Status
Required for next phase:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]/[db]?sslmode=require"
GROQ_API_KEY="[Your Groq API Key]"  # Will be needed for API implementation
```

## API Implementation Plan
Ready to implement:
- Groq API endpoints for models:
  * llama-3.3-70b-versatile
  * mixtral-8x7b-32768
  * gemma2-9b-it
  * distil-whisper-large-v3-en
- Response processing logic
- Metrics calculation system

## Next Steps
- Implement actual API route for model comparison
- Add proper error boundaries
- Retry shadcn/ui installation
- Create MetricsSection component
- Add proper JSDoc comments
- Replace mock API with real implementation
- Add loading skeletons
- Implement proper error handling
- Add response formatting options

## Notes & Comments
- Keep mock API for testing until real implementation
- Consider adding loading skeleton for responses
- Need to implement proper error handling
- Consider adding response formatting options
- Document all component props
- Add proper JSDoc comments
- Consider adding response comparison features
- Think about adding response analytics
